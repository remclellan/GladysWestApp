		This first part of this function to read satelite data only read 
		satellite data. students need to change the pathToJSONDataFiles 
		variable so it works on your computer.

		this is *windows* path, not a mac path.
		if you do not know what a path (on a computer) is, you should use google and
		youtube to learn, or come to office hours so I can explain it to you.

		students will need to change this pathToJSONDataFiles variable to point to
		where you have the data files stoed on your computer.  If you do not
		change it, the code will not "work".

		You can/should remove this long comment before you submit your work.  
		I'm just giving advice to try to help you. Good luck!  -Gabriel :)

		tip: here is where students need to look through the data variable
		read from the satellites and find a matching x,y to return the value.
		to understand better, open and look at the json satellite data in
